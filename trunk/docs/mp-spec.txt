1. Operating system and software developers must ensure that data is aligned
if locked access is required, because lock operations on misaligned data are
not guaranteed to work on all platforms.

2. I/O device drivers must serialize instructions to ensure that the device 
interrupt clear command reaches the device before the EOI command reaches the
APIC and handles the spurious interrupt in case one occurs.

3. To ensure software compatibility with all versions of APIC implementations, 
software developers must follow the following programming guidelines:

1). Assign an 8-bit APIC ID starting from zero.
2). Assign logical destinations starting from the most significant byte of the 
32-bit register.
3). Program the APIC spurious vector to hexadecimal "xF", where x is a 4-bit 
hexadecimal number.

4. Operating systems must use interrupt vector 16 to manage floating point 
exceptions when the system is in symmetric mode.

5. Non-default APIC base addresses can be used if the MP configuration table is 
provided.

6. Local APIC IDs must be unique, and need not be consecutive.

7. The ID of each I/O APIC unit is set to zero during RESET. It is the 
responsibility of the operating system to verify the uniqueness of the I/O
APIC ID and to assign a unique ID if a conflict is found.

The assignment of APIC IDs for I/O units must always begin from the lowest 
number that is possible after the assignment of local APIC IDs. The operating 
system must not attempt to change the ID of an APIC I/O unit if the preset
ID number is acceptable.
