Registers %rbp, %rbx and %r12 through %r15 belong to the calling function 
and the called function is required to preserve their values. If a calling
function wants to preserve such a register value across a function call,
it must save the value in its local stack frame.

The direction flag DF in the %rFLAGS register must be clear (set to "forward"
direction) on function entry and return. 

%rdi - 1st argument
%rsi - 2nd argument
%rdx - 3rd argument
%rcx - 4th argument
%r8  - 5th argument
%r9  - 6th argument
%rax - 1st return register
%rdx - 2nd return register
%rbx - callee-saved register; optionally used as base pointer
%rbp - callee-saved register; optionally used as frame pointer
%rsp - stack pointer
%r10 - temporary register, used for passing a function's static chain pointer
%r11 - temporary register
%r12-r15 - callee-saved registers
%fs - Reserved for system (as thread specific data register)
